# Purpose

This project is designed to take an amino acid sequence and convert it into a nucleotide sequence. The higher level purpose of this project is to create a different view of codon bias and how we model it. Here, we attempt to model codon bias as a natural language processing problem, specifically, translation. Generating a language model that can then be used to translate one amino acid sequence string to a nucleotide sequence string provides a method for genering sequences that can be inserted into vectors that are optimized for the codon bias of a particular organism.
